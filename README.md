# prone

Better exception reporting middleware for Ring. Heavily inspired by
[better_errors for Rails](https://github.com/charliesome/better_errors).

## Usage

Add it as a middleware to your Ring stack:

```clj
(ns example
  (:require [prone.middleware :as prone]))

(def app
  (-> my-app
      prone/wrap-exceptions))
```

## Known problems

- We have not yet found a way to differentiate `some-name` and `some_name`
  function names by inspecting the stack trace. Currently, we assume kebab case.

## Contribute

Yes, please do. And add tests for your feature or fix, or we'll certainly break
it later.

#### Up and running

To start the server:

- run `lein cljsbuild auto` in one terminal
- run `lein ring server-headless` in another.

`lein test` will run all tests.
